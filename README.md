1. download/close this repository, and change directory into this repository
2. type "python nerual_network_design.py", see the results of BPneural networks when hidden layer is different
3. type "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3333", start listening at PORT=3333
4. tpye "python server.py", run server-side code
5. open a browser, type in address "localhost:3333", see the magic :)
